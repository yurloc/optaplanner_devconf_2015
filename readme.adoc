= OptaPlanner DevConf Workshop 2015

== TASK 1
. Open project in Java IDE youâ€˜ve selected (just click on parent pom.xml).
. Open module called `cloudbalance-easymodel`.
. Search for `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/domain` package and get familiar with Java classes.
  - Which are planning entities and what are their variables?
  - Where they get values for variables?

== TASK 2
. Open `src/main/resources/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml`.
. Execute `run_easy.sh` (or `run_easy.bat`), pick "15 computers with 45 processes" scenario and see what Planner does.
  - graphic output (very fast, you may miss it)
  - see log in terminal
. Try to uncomment "localsearch" section in `cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml` and repeat step 1.
. Observe the score difference.
  - why is score better?
  - is there possibility that score after localsearch phase is not better? and why?

== TASK 3
. Open module called `cloudbalance-sophisticated`.
. Search for `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/domain` package and get familiar with Java classes.
  - there are extra annotations
  - there are extra files (comparators) - why do we need them? see in code
  - run construction heuristic only and compare time and score differences with TASK2
    - config file: `src/main/resources/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml`
. Search for `src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/solver/score`.
  - check EasyScore score function and IncrementalScoreFunction
    - why do we need incremental score function?
    - in `cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml` try speed difference between easy and incremental score calculation

== TASK 4 (optional)
. Pick one score calculation and add a new hard constraint: no computer should have more than 4 processes assigned to it.
  - note: incremental and map based scoreFunctions are harder for implementation
